[PWA overview]

    Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that offer a user experience similar to native mobile apps. 
    They are built using standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
    but provide additional features and capabilities that make them more robust, fast, and engaging.

    Key Features:
        ### Offline Access: Through service workers, PWAs can cache content and functionality for offline usage.

        ### Push Notifications: PWAs can send notifications to the user's device, similar to native apps.

        ### Fast Loading: Techniques like lazy loading and optimized assets make PWAs faster to load.

        ### Installable: Users can add PWAs to their home screen, making them easily accessible without needing to go through an app store.

        ### Responsive: Designed to work on any device, PWAs are built to be fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

        ### Secure: PWAs are served over HTTPS, ensuring that all data is encrypted.

        ### Cross-platform: Being web-based, they work across multiple platforms, saving development time and effort.

        ### Up-to-Date: Due to service worker updates, PWAs are always up-to-date with the latest features and security patches.

    In essence, PWAs combine the best aspects of web and native apps, providing a more seamless, reliable, and engaging user experience
